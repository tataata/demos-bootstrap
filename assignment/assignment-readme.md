# Bootstrap: Rapid prototyping with Components

Quickly prototype the landing page for a fictional product using Bootstrap. Use its default styles.

**Ideas for fictional product:**

- Organisation promoting services/event (e.g. school promoting the new course, library promoting reading club, a recently opened restaurant, etc)
- E-commerce organisation promoting start of sale (e.g. seasonal sale of clothes, bike shop promoting a new model of the bike, etc)
- Your idea that you might have that suits the use case of the informative landing page.

## Requirements

**The landing page should contain the following:**

- header with a navigation bar
- hero section showcasing the product
- section with cards
- section with pricing or/and testimonials
- footer

**Implement responsive design** to ensure the page looks good across different screen sizes.

**Bonus:**

- Contact form
- Add a modal component
- Add a carousel

**The scope:**

- Customisation of the components is out of scope of this assignment and is optional. Priority is to compose the landing page with the blocks listed in the requirements. Proceed introducing the custom CSS on top of Bootstrap when finished the first iteration of the layout and its responsiveness.
- **Text content:** you can use lorem ipsum from generator of your choice, e.g. [https://loremipsum.io/#generator](https://loremipsum.io/#generator) or from AI chat bot of your choice.
- **Imagery:** you can use placeholders, e.g. from [https://placehold.co/](https://placehold.co/), [https://placekitten.com/](https://placekitten.com/), [https://placebear.com/](​​https://placebear.com/), [https://picsum.photos/](https://picsum.photos/) or free licence images published on [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/)
