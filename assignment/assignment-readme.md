# Bootstrap: Rapid prototyping with Components (in two parts)

Quickly prototype the landing page for a fictional product using Bootstrap:

1. Iteration 1: composing responsive layout
2. Iteration 2: further work on the prototype, custom styling

**Ideas for fictional product:**

- Organisation promoting services/event (e.g. school promoting the new course, library promoting reading club, a recently opened restaurant, etc)
- E-commerce organisation promoting start of sale (e.g. seasonal sale of clothes, bike shop promoting a new model of the bike, etc)
- Your idea that you might have that suits the use case of the informative landing page.

**Scope:**

- One-page website. Navigation is implemented with anchor links on the same page.
- **Text content:** you can use lorem ipsum generators of your choice, e.g. [https://loremipsum.io/#generator](https://loremipsum.io/#generator) or an AI chatbot of your choice.
- **Imagery:** you can use placeholders, e.g. from [https://placehold.co/](https://placehold.co/), [https://placekitten.com/](https://placekitten.com/), [https://placebear.com/](​​https://placebear.com/), [https://picsum.photos/](https://picsum.photos/) or free licence images published on [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/) or any others of your choice.
- Customisation of the Bootstrap elements with **CSS only**.

   Have a look at how Bootstrap examples are done (view the source of the page, inspect the elements in webdev tools), re-use and adjust techniques used there.

3. For using interactive components you need to include Bootstrap JS. Reference how to do it via CDN [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/#cdn-via-jsdelivr](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/#cdn-via-jsdelivr)

## Iteration 1: Composing responsive layout

**The scope:**
Creation responsive layout for the landing page.
Customisation of the styles page is out of scope of this part of the assignment.

**Suggestion on use of color in this iteration:**
Start to work in a minimal color scheme, e.g. greyscale (dark or light scheme). If needed, use color accent on elements like links, icons, buttons or other controls of interactive elements. Customising the colors might be postponed to the 2nd iteration.

### Requirements

Use the [Bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/) for composing responsive layout of the page.

**The landing page should contain the following elements:**

- header with a navigation bar
- hero section or jumbotron showcasing the product/service/event
- section with cards: pricing or/and testimonials
- footer
- any other content blocks that are relevant for your product/service/event

Layout should be responsive

- ensure the page looks good and content accessible across different screen sizes.

**Bonuses:**

- Make header sticky
- Add a contact form or a form to sign up to the newsletter
- Add a modal component
- Add a carousel

## Iteration 2: Customisation of the prototype

### Task

When you have a responsive layout of the landing page ready, gather feedback from a **minimum of 2 peers**.

Make adjustments if needed after the peer reviews.

Customize styles of the layout:

- introduce custom styles for the elements,
- add your custom selectors,
- re-define Bootstrap CSS variables,
- introduce your own CSS variables when needed.
