# Bootstrap: exploration of utility classes

This assignment will help you to get familiar with the set of basics Bootstrap utility classes. Enjoy!

# Task

Use `page-content.md` provided for the content of your page.

1. Start a new project. Add Bootsrap CSS only to it via CDN.
2. Create layout that you have as a reference in the `mockup` folder. No optimisation for particular breakpoint (for now) is required at this point. But make sure the page layout is responsive across various screen sizes (extra small, small, middle, large and extra large ones).
3. No CSS overrides (maybe only outline for marking containers, if you prefer). Only use of what Bootstrap has to offer.

## The scope and references

Use [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) for the reference while working.

Following sections in the documentation might be helpful during work on this assignment:

- Layot: Breakpoints, Containers
- Utilities: Colors, Background, Spacing, Sizing, Text, Borders
- Content: Typography, Images, Tables
- Helpers: Color and background, Focus ring, Icon link

Also, expect **refreshers** on the HTML and Markdown on the way. In particular:

1. HTML: use `<abbr>` as needed to mark the abbriviations in the text.
2. HTML: table
