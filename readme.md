# Hello here!

This branch demoes Bootstrap added via CDN and utilities classes.

## Suggested flow of the demo

**Important:** Work with the Bootstrap doc during the demo.

### Why Bootstrap at all

1. Copy paste any code snippet from the Bootstrap doc (for example [Pricing page layout example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/pricing/)). Copy paste HTML between the body w/o JS. Show to the audience.
2. Add Bootstrap via CDN only CSS. Show to the audience. Focus on responsiveness. Read the code (inspector) and bring attentoin to the pre-defined custom classes.
3. Clean you index and do the demo of creating the page from scratch.

### Demo from scratch

1. Start creating layout similar looking to waht is in the assignment. Demo of 1/3 or 1/2 is enough. Let the students repeat what you did and expand further.
2. Check **Layout/Breakpoints** in the doc.
3. Check **Layout/Containers** in the doc. We going to use for this demo only `.container` and `.container-fluid` for now. Start writing HTML.
4. **Helpers/Colors**: Add background to the `body`
5. Use the content from [Bootstrap wikipedia page](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)>) to build up the page when demoing. Add `header`, `h1` add couple of paragraphs of text from the wiki page.
6. **Utilities/Spacing** Add spacing to the container and header. Showcase how to add CSS classes in web dev tools and to check which styles are available in the library. `mt-4` to container.
7. **Utility/Sizing** + **Content/Images** Place the image in the text. Position it with `img-fluid w-100 my-3`.
8. **Typography/List** Add paragraph and list after the image.
9. **Icon/Link** Add a link and use code snippet for the icon link: `icon-link icon-link-hover`
10. **Helpers/Focus ring** Explore code snippet in the doc and remove what is not needed. In this demo it settled on `focus-ring focus-ring-light`
