# Bootstrap: grid exploration

## Task

Use Bootstrap responsive grid classes and flexbox utilities to reproduce the same responsive behaviour of the layout as on mockups.

Use the HTML starter provided in the `starter-markup.html`.

We work with Botstrap CSS only, the CSS overrides would be exessive.

## References and other leads

Use [Bootstrap documnetation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/) during the work on this assignment.
